In this lab, I understand the workflow of setting up a clean and reproducible computation environment, especially creating a project foler, configuring a virtual environment in VS Code, and installing necessary Python packages. I assumed that the CSV follows the required format with the columns id, lon, and lat, and that the values in lon and lat are numeric and represent geographic coordinates. I relied on the assumption that the CSV is well-structured, consistenly formatted, and readable by pandas. Automating steps such as environment activation, dependency tracking, and version control actions like commit, push, and pull helps reduce human mistakes, while I still need to make decisions about what changes are meaningful to commit and how to organize files properly. I also realized that as projects grow, managing environments, dependenies, and Git histories can become more complex. Therefore, having a consistent workfloww early on is important to aviod problems later.
